Tiny Language Compiler in C#

This project is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that functions as a simple compiler for a custom Tiny Language. The application provides an interactive graphical interface where users can input Tiny Language source code directly into a text box. Upon pressing the Compile button, the system processes the input in several stages using two main components: a Scanner and a Parser.

Key Features:

Lexical Analysis (Scanner):
The Scanner reads the user's code character by character and breaks it down into individual lexemes. Each lexeme is matched to a predefined token class (e.g., identifier, keyword, number, operator). The recognized tokens are then displayed in a Token Table, showing the lexeme and its corresponding token type.

Error Detection:
If the Scanner encounters any lexical errors (e.g., invalid identifiers, unclosed strings, illegal symbols) or if the Parser detects syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons, unbalanced parentheses, incorrect structure), the system will display detailed Error Messages indicating the issue and its location in the code.

Syntax Analysis (Parser):
The Parser uses the stream of tokens generated by the Scanner to check if the sequence follows the grammar rules of the Tiny Language. If valid, it constructs and displays a Parse Tree, providing a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of the input code.

This modular approach allows for clear separation between lexical and syntactic analysis. The design can be easily extended to support more language features in the future.
